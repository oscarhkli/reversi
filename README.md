# Reversi

Reversi is a full-stack multiplayer Reversi game with multiple rooms and real-time gameplay using WebSocket.

## Goal
- To learn Go and WebSocket for backend development
- To learn TypeScript for frontend development
- To see how far I can go with using vanilla TypeScript

## Design

Multiplayer turn-based game, in a nutshell, is a variant of a chatroom.

In a chatroom app:
1. Client A sends a message to the Chatroom Server.
2. Chatroom Server processes the message, and broadcast a message in the room.
3. Client B receives the message through the display of the Chatroom.
4. Continue...

In a turn-based game:
1. Client A sends a message containing the move details to the Game Server.
2. Game Server validates the message, calculates the next state, and broadcast the result in the game room.
3. Client B receives the results through the display of the game room.
4. Continue...

All communications within Clients and Server are formed by WebSocket.

TODO: Tradeoff between pure WebSocket vs hybrid of WebSocket & RESTful
