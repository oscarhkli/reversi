# Reversi

Reversi is a full-stack multiplayer Reversi game with multiple rooms and real-time gameplay using WebSocket.

## Goal
- To learn Go and WebSocket for backend development
- To learn TypeScript for frontend development
- To see how far I can go with using vanilla TypeScript

## Design
All communications within Clients and Server are formed by WebSocket.

TODO: Tradeoff between pure WebSocket vs hybrid of WebSocket & RESTful
